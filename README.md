Readme AR-FORM
1)Introdution
	This app makes use of AR technology to tackle three problems 
	1)Firstly the negligence and careless attitude of the people while filling the form to the terms and conditions.
`	2)Filling complex government forms having many fields.
	3)Inability of people to know about the Government Schemes.
2)Our app tackes these problems in the following ways:
	1)This app provides embedded graphics using Augmented reality to explain the term and condition to the users in an easy and interactive way.
	2)The app using AR shows the user what the important fields are and how to appropriately fill them to enable the user to be able to fill these 		forms efficiently.This app can be a major plus point especially for the people with learning disabilty.
	3)The government schemes printed in multipaged pamphelets are hardly read by anyone which leaves them unattended.
